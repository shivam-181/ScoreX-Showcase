🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion.

Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript.

Database: MongoDB (via Mongoose).

AI Engine: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (via @google/generative-ai).

💻 Featured Code: AI Persona Injection

While the full codebase is private, here is a look at how ScoreX handles the AI personality injection. We utilize system prompting to ensure the model behaves like a "passionate fan" rather than a robotic assistant.

// ScoreX AI Integration Logic (Backend)

// Initialize Gemini with the Flash 2.0 model for low latency
const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY || '');
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-2.0-flash" });

router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
    const { message } = req.body;
    
    // System Prompt: Defines the AI's persona as a witty football expert
    // This ensures consistency in tone across the application
    const systemPrompt = `
      You are ScoreX AI, a passionate and knowledgeable football assistant.
      Tone: Enthusiastic, professional, slightly witty.
      Context: The user is on "ScoreX", a modern football scores app.
      User Query: ${message}
    `;

    try {
        const result = await model.generateContent(systemPrompt);
        const response = result.response.text();
        res.json({ response });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("AI Generation Error:", error);
        res.status(500).json({ error: "VAR Check in progress... (AI Error)" });
    }
});
