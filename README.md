## 💻 Featured Code: AI Persona Injection

While the full codebase is private, here is how ScoreX injects its football-expert personality using a system-level prompt.

```ts
// ScoreX AI Integration Logic (Backend)

const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY || '');
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-2.0-flash" });

router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
    const { message } = req.body;

    // System Prompt: Defines the AI's persona as a witty football expert
    const systemPrompt = `
      You are ScoreX AI, a passionate and knowledgeable football assistant.
      Tone: Enthusiastic, professional, slightly witty.
      Context: The user is on "ScoreX", a modern football scores app.
      User Query: ${message}
    `;

    try {
        const result = await model.generateContent(systemPrompt);
        const response = result.response.text();
        res.json({ response });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("AI Generation Error:", error);
        res.status(500).json({ error: "VAR Check in progress... (AI Error)" });
    }
});
```
