🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion
Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
Database: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
AI Engine: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (via @google/generative-ai)

💻 Featured Code: AI Persona Injection
While the full codebase is private, here is how ScoreX handles the AI personality injection. The system prompt ensures the model behaves like a passionate football fan instead of a generic assistant.

ts
Copy code
// ScoreX AI Integration Logic (Backend)

// Initialize Gemini with the Flash 2.0 model for low latency
const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY || '');
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-2.0-flash" });

router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
    const { message } = req.body;

    // System Prompt: Defines the AI's persona as a witty football expert
    const systemPrompt = `
      You are ScoreX AI, a passionate and knowledgeable football assistant.
      Tone: Enthusiastic, professional, slightly witty.
      Context: The user is on "ScoreX", a modern football scores app.
      User Query: ${message}
    `;

    try {
        const result = await model.generateContent(systemPrompt);
        const response = result.response.text();
        res.json({ response });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("AI Generation Error:", error);
        res.status(500).json({ error: "VAR Check in progress... (AI Error)" });
    }
});
